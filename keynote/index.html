				<section id="">
					<h2>Obligatory slide with an unnumbered list on it</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Dumb luck talked me into doing the keynote</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">One of them is that - well, the reason I'm doing the "Keynote" is that in our Kohathon planning meetings, I said that if there were any blank spots on the schedule, or if anyone cancelled, I'd fill in for them.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Obligatory slide with an unnumbered list on it</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Dumb luck talked me into doing the keynote</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This is why the alternate title for this presentation is "George talks about something weird."</p>

					<h2>koha-US 2019 Officers</h2>
					<img src="./images/kohaus2019a.jpg" height="325">
					<p>Several of these people were on the Kohathon Committee.</p>
					<aside class="notes">I agreed to fill in for one slot later tonight where we didn't have anyone to talk and then the only person who cancelled, happened to be in this slot. So I agreed to fill it and everyone said "Thanks, George" and I
						felt like I had done something nice.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>koha-US 2019 Officers</h2>
					<img src="./images/kohaus2019.jpg" height="325">
					<p>I don't have pictures of everyone who laughed, but these are two of them.</p>
					<aside class="notes">Then about a week later at another meeting we were talking about the Kohathon schedule and someone asked a question about the Keynote speaker and a couple of people said "George is doing the keynote." and I said "I'm
						doing the keynote?" And everone laughed and said, "Yes, that's the person who couldn't attend and you said you'd fill in for them." And then there was a lot of swearing.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Obligatory slide with an unnumbered list on it</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Dumb luck talked me into doing the keynote</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Volunteering is a bad idea.</p>
					<aside class="notes">So I'm doing the keynote today because, out of all the people I could have filled in for, the only one that was unlucky enough to have to cancel was the keynote speaker. So luck played a part in my being here today.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Coworkers were no help</h2>
					<img src="./images/slack.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">The second reason I thought I'd talk about luck is that when I told my coworkers that I was doing the keynote and that I had absolutely no idea what I was going to talk about they all said "Good luck with that."</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2></h2>
					<h2>Obligatory slide with an unnumbered list on it</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Dumb luck talked me into doing the keynote</li>
						<li>Everyone said "Good luck"</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">I figured, then, if everyone is going to say "Good luck," even if they were saying it ironically, maybe I should actually talk about luck.</aside>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Obligatory slide with an unnumbered list on it</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Dumb luck talked me into doing the keynote</li>
						<li>Everyone said "Good luck"</li>
						<li>Staff often feel like luck is all they have</li>
					</ul>
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">The third reason is that I've worked with a lot of staff at a lot of libraries and staff often feel like the only factor that plays a part in the ILS they're using is luck. A lot of staff feel like they have no control
						over the features in their ILS because they're often not the people who make decisions about the ILS.</aside>

					<p>I worked for Boise Public Library from 1997-2002.</p>

					<h2>A Reasonable Request</h2>
					<img src="./images/rays.jpg" height="325">

					<aside class="notes">I read them.<br />It's as simple as that. I try to take some time every week to read through a list of bugs on Bugzilla and I try to read the ones that I think might impact me.</aside>

					<h2>Sign off</h2>
					<img src="./images/wf040.png" height="325">
					<p>Yeah, I'm not going to talk about that today.</p>
					<aside class="notes">Sure, sometimes I sign off on them, but I'm not going to go into signing off on a patch in this presentation. That's for another program. But just going through and reading the bugs and the comments helps me know what's
						going on in Koha this week.</aside>

					<h2>A Really Simple Example</h2>
					<img src="./images/qf010.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">Last July I was doing reading through the recent bugs and I came across bug 23389. The title was "Add 'All' option to report value dropdowns." And I thought, hey, I have a work-around for that that I've been using for
						years. This is cool.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Nick wrote a patch</h2>
					<img src="./images/qf020.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">I read the comments and the test plan and I immediately thought - woah - this is not what I want. I have reports in my system with drop-downs that, if I ran them with an "All" option, they'd time out.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>I commented</h2>
					<img src="./images/qf030.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">So, I made a comment. I like the idea, but can you make it optional because I don't want it on all of my reports.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Nick changed the patch and addressed my comments</h2>
					<img src="./images/qf040.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">And a day later Nick added a new patch that had did the same thing, but "All" was optional.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Discussions are Good</h2>
					<img src="./images/discussion.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">Having these kinds of discussions is what the developers want. The developers want to make Koha work better. But they can't do that without feedback from us.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Make your own luck in 3 steps</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Listen</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Ask questions</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out">Make suggestions</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Ok. This is the last time you'll see this list.</p>
					<aside class="notes">And the easiest steps you can take in order to give feedback to the developers are Listen to what's going on, to ask questions, and to make suggestions.</aside>
				</section>

				<section id="">
					<h2>Have a Happy Day</h2>
					<img src="./images/cookies.jpg" height="325">
					<p></p>
					<aside class="notes">If everyone that uses Koha takes these simple setps, then the future of Koha is going to be just fine.</aside>
